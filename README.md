Where am I?
===========
This is what we call a *repository*, basically a place where you
share textual data, usually source code.

Instead of code, this repository tries to hold resources and
answer questions on *how to start programming*

Why does this exist?
--------------------
This started when We got a quite healthy discussion in our workplace
chat when a coworker asked about resources to learn programming from
scratch.  The discussion quickly went to pros/cons of how suited
different programming languages would be for starting.

As I've seen the question repeated in various subreddits time and
time again, this repository is here to try and collect answers
from different individuals. 

The short conclusion was "it depends" so I suggest checking
out our [pros/cons list](which_language.md)


About materials linked
----------------------
We try to curate the material links, but as we are not familiar
with every language under the sun, that is not perfect.  We also
try to get people to check if the maetrials are of good quality.

Free to file issues if you find some of the materials confusing,
unhelpful or otherwise bad.
