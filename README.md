About this repository
=====================
We got a quite healthy discussion in our workplace chat when a
coworker asked about resources to learn programming from scratch.
The discussion quickly went to pros/cons of how suited different
programming languages would be for starting.

As I've seen the question repeated in various subreddits time and
time again, this repository is here to try and collect answers
from different individuals. 

The short conclusion was "it depends" so I suggest checking
out our [pros/cons list](which_language.md)
